# Animation-Programming

A program to animate the Unreal mannequin with bones

## Running the tests

1. MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING RELEASE AND X86. THE ENGINE DOES NOT SUPPORT OTHER MODES.
2. Press Play
3. If you want to change the animation speed, use 'DOWN' to slow it down, use 'UP' to go faster.
4. If you want to switch between animations, you can use '1' to go to Walking animation, '2' to use Running animation.

Notes : The animation doesn't cycle perfectly seamlessly. We skip the last frame so it doesn't slow down the overall animation, 
but he get a very subtil unnatural movement on the right knee as the animation restarts. This is the best we
could do.
